# CYD Snap Lid case with portrait or landscape feet

This is a click together case for the CYD with optional feet that can be used to hold the case in portrait or landscape

Designed by Havenview.

## Files

I have added the design files in the following formats:

 - f3d - For import into Fusion 360
 - step - For import in other CAD software

## Printing Details

- Main case consists of case front, case rear and case back panel
- As a stand alone case, the back panel glues in place
- You can modify that back panel to add other holes/features for connectors etc
- drill out the guides on the back panel and add heatset inserts in the case rear to allow M3 cap head screws to attach the feet

## Additional Hardware Required

- 2x M3 SHCS, length 16mm and 2x M3x4 heatset inserts if you want to use the feet
- Heatset inserts available here: [CNC Kitchen](https://cnckitchen.store/products/gewindeeinsatz-threaded-insert-m3-short-100-stk-pcs) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/KITCHEN-Original-Threaded-Insert-Version/dp/B09FXNX6WF)

Instructions for using the inserts [can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-UF4tv3Hvc&t=368s).
