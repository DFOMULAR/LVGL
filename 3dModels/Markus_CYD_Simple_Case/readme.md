## Simple CYD housing

I needed a simple case for the CYD in landscape mode. Main goals:
- Small case
- Supports CYD version with USB-C port
- Opening for light sensitive resistor (LDR) to allow automatic scren brightness adjustment. This requires a solid light barrier between the display and the LDR, otherwise the automatic adjustment is influenced by the backlight LEDs themselves
- Opening in the back for the LED
- Boot and reset buttons can be pushed via buttons in the back plane of the housing
- Front does not interfere witht he touch display
And last not lease: stable housing that actually fits - I did some test prints to ensure that no rework is needed to fit the CYD into the housing

The design is based on Leo Ruiz' housing : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5990927, but completely redone in Fusion 360
Fusion 360 File is included

### Printing Details

- Housing has been tested on Ender3 S1 
- Parameters: PLA, 0.16 mm, 205°C Nozzle, 60°C Bed


### Additional Hardware Required
