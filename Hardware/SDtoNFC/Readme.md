# SD to NFC Adaptor
This is a PCB for breaking out the pins of the MicroSD Card. It is specifically designed for the red PN532 NFC module, but it can be used for anything.

## What PCB Thickness to order

SD cards are typically 0.75mm thick, but that is not a typical PCB thickness that is offered by the fab houses

The SD card sniffer I bought from Aliexpress was 1mm thick

I've ordered both 0.8mm and 1mm PCBs from JLC and both worked ok.
